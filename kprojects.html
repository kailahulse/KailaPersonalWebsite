        <h1 id="Systems">Systems based and Backend projects:</h1>
        <h3 id="X16">X16</h3>
        <p>Created a full X16 compiler simulation in C, organized into four separate files with approximately 700 lines of optimized code.
            Implemented diverse bit manipulation methods, including sign extension and custom bit-width return functions.
            Accomplished the tasks of handling all 14 X16 commands, running games like 2048, and compressing assembly files into .obj files, all without memory leaks.</p>
        <h3 id="ELVIS">ELVIS</h3>
        <p>Collaborating with a 15-member research team at Western Washington University to construct one of the
            largest virtual Internet simulations using Rust, despite having no prior experience in this area. The primary
            goal was to create a comprehensive model of the Internet, enabling simulations of DDOS attacks and the
            dark web to enhance online privacy. Our group has successfully tested and implemented smaller components of this ambitious research, including ARP
            routers, DNS, DHCP, TCP, and various network configurations. The overarching objective was to develop a
            highly complex and realistic Internet simulation.
            I have personally contributed to the research by playing a key role in building TcpStream and TcpListener
            components. Additionally, I utilized a Weibull Distribution formula to simulate user behavior while
            browsing the Internet. These components were rigorously tested in conjunction with a custom-built server,
            enabling seamless web browsing with HTTP links and embedded images. My new endeavor is to build a complex simulation that runs all the applications at the same time
            thus out research will reach new heights and be able to measure our speed and effectiveness of the applications and protocols the team has built.

        <h3 id ="4Human Co.">4Human Co. Software Developer Intern</h3>
        <p>Developing for a non-profit organization that works to build software for other non-profit organizations. Current project includes building 
            an e-commerce website for another non-profit that includes features such as being able to buy products off the website along with login information for user’s 
            information. Personal contributions include helping to design the database that holds user’s 
            login information as well as implementing the transaction process using Express and PostgreSQL.</p>

        <h3 id="web">This Website!</h3>
        <p>I have created and developed multiple design aspects into this website that displays my portfolio and other skills.
            The website was developed using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and all ideas and creative aspects came from myself. The usage
            of highlighting text and adding links to other websites add flare and demonstrate knowledge on creating websites.

        <h3 id="Behavior Better">Behavior Made Better</h3>
        <p> Collaborating in a team of three using Twine, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop educational software
            designed to assist educators, particularly professors and teachers, in effectively instructing students with
            disabilities. Our team is working closely with a disabilities professor based in Colorado to create a comprehensive program. This
            software will include instructional materials, images, and lessons tailored for educators, enabling them to
            acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to deliver an optimal educational experience for students with
            diverse disabilities. The primary objective of this initiative was to equip educators with the tools and resources required to
            ensure that students with a wide range of disabilities could enjoy a rich and fulfilling school experience</p>
